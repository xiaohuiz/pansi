# pansi
Poor man's ansible, a command line SSH helper tool.

It's just a screwdriver, not a set of tools you have to learn about. 

what it can do :
1. run command remotely
2. ship and run script remotely
3. run against multiple servers in parallel
4. interactive (no parallel)

For people who use SSH a lot. 

In [bin](https://github.com/laowangv5/pansi/tree/master/bin) you can download the binary version which is wrapped by PyInstaller. With this you can save some time without having to setup python environment.  I build them on a rather old server so I suppose it would run well on most Linux servers.
